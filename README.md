# Aux Funcs

This repository contains some funcs that I used to execute
on my Jupyter Notebooks to accomplish certain tasks like plot vectors, 
matrices and many more.

**Manage required Python packages with requirements.txt:**

In order to install required packages please run the next command line inside your folder project
where the funcs are needed.

`pip install -r requirements.txt -v`
